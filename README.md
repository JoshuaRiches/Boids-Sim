# Boids Sim
This project was developed as part of a university assignment. The aim of the assignment was to use the assimp library to develop a 3d model renderer. Then with that rendering system we had to create an object oriented system which was then used to create boids/flocking behaviours.

Functionality:
The boids in this system follow the standard flocking behaviours of; cohesion, allignment, separation and wandering. They remain bound within the clear box in the scene. They also avoid the red box in the scene.
You can use the GUI to modify the number of boids in the scene, the wieghting of each of the boid behaviours, and the position of the red box.
